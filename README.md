# Django Word Counter API
A simple word counter API made with Django Rest Framework.

If you want to know how many times a word is written on a page, just use this API and you will receive the data as JSON.

Getting Started

The API still needs some adjustments that will be made soon. 
Here's a list of what it requires to be better:

~~Tests~~ 

`A new index page with the documentation (figure out how to use 'restframework-swagger' properly`

`A new class to return all words in a page and each occurrence`
